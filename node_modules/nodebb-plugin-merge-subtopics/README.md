# nodebb-plugin-merge-subtopics
Merge topics from sub-categories into /category views.

When browsing a category in a NodeBB forum, the default mode is to show only
the topics made to this category. This plugin allows you to merge the topics
made to the current category, as well as the topics made to sub-categories
(this mimics the way other popular forum software such as phpBB handle
sub-topics).

No particular configuration is required, except install and enable the plugin.
