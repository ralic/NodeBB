![Alt text](/nodeplugins.jpg "Exodo plugins")

Plugin to ignore post from certain users.


You can ignore user posts while reading threads. On the right of each username will appear an eye icon, pressing that icon will ignore/unignore that user.

You can also ignore users from user profiles. the option is located in the profile dropdown of the user.

From your profile page, you can see the list of users you are ignoring and you have the option to unignore them too.

If you have an user ignored, you will not see his posts, you will see a generic text telling you that user is ignored and the posts will appear faded itself.
