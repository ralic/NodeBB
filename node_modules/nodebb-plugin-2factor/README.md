# Two-Factor Authentication for NodeBB

In addition to regular authentication via username/password or SSO, a second layer of security can be configured, permitting access only if
a time-based one-time password is supplied, typically generated/stored on a mobile device.

The Two-Factor Authentication plugin will expose this feature to end-users, allowing them to configure their
devices and enabling this enhanced security on their account.

## Installation

Install the plugin via the ACP/Plugins page.
